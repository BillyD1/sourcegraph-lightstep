# LightStep for Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph extension that shows information from LightStep in OpenTracing instrumentation code.

## Roadmap

- Add at-a-glance summary about a span in a hover message.
- Display all spans in the current file, tree, and repository.
- Support usage in the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension).
- Link to LightStep queries for tags and other properties of a span.
- Show all recent tag values for a span (for all tags, and for each tag defined in a call).
- Show spans that contain a given span.
