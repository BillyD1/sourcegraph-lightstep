# LightStep for Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph extension that shows information from LightStep in OpenTracing instrumentation code.

**NOTE:** Using this extension on private code in the [Sourcegraph browser extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_extension) requires a [self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart) (because it needs access to the contents of the current file).
